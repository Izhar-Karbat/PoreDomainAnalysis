Core data models for the enhanced report generator.

This module defines the primary data structures used throughout the report generation pipeline:
- MetricResult: Represents a single metric with comparison data between toxin and control groups
- ReportSection: Represents a thematic section in the report containing related metrics
- RunMetadata: Contains high-level metadata about the simulation runs being compared
