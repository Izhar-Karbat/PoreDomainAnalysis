# Documentation Guidelines

- **Docstrings:**  
  - Use numpy‑style (Parameters / Returns / Raises) in every public function.  
  - Include a one‑sentence summary, followed by detailed parameter descriptions.  
  - Note side effects (e.g., file outputs, logging).

- **README & Markdown:**  
  - When adding or changing features, update `README.md` with usage examples.  
  - Include CLI invocation examples for new flags or scripts.  
  - Keep prose concise and use bullet lists for steps.

- **Inline Comments:**  
  - Add comments for any non‑obvious logic, especially scientific calculations or workarounds.  
  - Avoid redundant comments—only explain “why,” not “what.”

- **Example Blocks:**  
  - Provide small code snippets in rules or docs if it clarifies usage patterns.
