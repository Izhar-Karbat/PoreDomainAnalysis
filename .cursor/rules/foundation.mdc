# Foundation — Core Project Conventions

1. **Naming & Structure**
   - All pore-related modules and functions use the prefix `pore_`.
   - Entry point is `pore_analysis/main.py` (invoked via `python -m pore_analysis.main --folder <path>`).
2. **Maintain Logic Integrity**
   - Do not alter scientific calculations (e.g., tolerance thresholds, formula implementations) without explicit prompt.
   - Preserve all existing validation and logging calls.
3. **Style & Quality**
   - Follow PEP8 conventions and Black formatting.
   - Every new or modified function must include type hints and a numpy‑style docstring.
4. **Testing Awareness**
   - After changes, manually verify core functionality with `tests/data/test.psf` & `tests/data/test.dcd`.
   - Do not remove or rename the sample data files.
