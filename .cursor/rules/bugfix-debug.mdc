# Bugfix & Debug Workflow

1. **Reproduce**  
   - Ask for steps to reproduce the error, including minimal code snippets or CLI commands.  
   - Verify the bug with the sample data (`tests/data/test.psf` & `tests/data/test.dcd`).

2. **Analyze**  
   - Examine relevant modules/functions: search for where the failing key or variable is defined and used.  
   - Consider dependencies (e.g., `results` dict keys, logging calls, conditional branches).

3. **Propose Fix**  
   - Describe the root cause in a sentence.  
   - Suggest targeted code changes (with line numbers if possible) to resolve the issue.  
   - Add any additional logging or validation to catch similar errors.

4. **Validate**  
   - Re-run reproduction steps; confirm the error no longer occurs.  
   - Ensure no new errors or side effects on toxin vs. control branches.

**Do not** remove existing validation or logging without explicit instruction.
