# Pore‑Domain Analysis Context

## Systems
- Toxin–channel complexes (e.g. Cs1 + K⁺ channel) and control channels alone.
- Focus on water‑mediated pore modulation: toxins disrupt H‑bond networks controlling water access.

## Key Metrics
- **G–G Distances:** Cα distances A–C and B–D as proxies for pore diameter/collapse.  
- **Ion Occupancy & Conduction:** K⁺ sites (S0–S4, Cavity) and conduction events.  
- **D‑W Gate Dynamics:** H‑bond network (D447–W434) controlling peripheral water access.  
- **Toxin Orientation & Contacts:** COM distances, orientation angles, and contact frequencies (toxin only).  
- **Carbonyl Flipping:** Backbone flips at G444/Y445 via gyration analysis.  
- **Water Dynamics:** Flow patterns and residence times in cavities and central pore.  
- **Tyrosine Rotamers:** Conformational states of filter‑adjacent tyrosine residues.

## Coding Conventions
- Handle toxin and control systems with conditional logic for toxin‑specific analyses.  
- Use the established `results` dict to pass data between steps.  
- Preserve module‑specific output directories as per the project structure.  
- Employ MDAnalysis for trajectory I/O and numpy/scipy for all array ops—no manual loops.  
- Maintain SI units (Å, ps) and existing variable names.  
- All functions require numpy‑style docstrings that note side effects (file outputs).
